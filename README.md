Background and Context: The ability to predict loan approval outcomes and assess financial risk is crucial for banks and financial institutions to make informed lending decisions. Creditworthiness and financial stability are key factors that influence loan approvals, and accurate predictions in these areas can reduce default rates, streamline lending processes, and enhance financial inclusion. This project aims to explore several machine learning models that can predict the binary outcome of loan approval based on a range of demographic, financial, and historical data. If time permitted, we will also do the risk score regression. 
Dataset Description: The dataset used for this project is a synthetic dataset designed for risk assessment and loan approval modeling from kaggle. It contains 20,000 records with 36 attributes related to demographic information, credit history, income levels, existing debt, and financial stability. Key features include age, credit score, employment status, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio, previous loan defaults, and more. This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for building models that predict a risk score (a regression problem) and loan approval status (a binary classification problem).
