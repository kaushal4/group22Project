# AML Group 22 Project

## Background and Context
The ability to predict loan approval outcomes and assess financial risk is crucial for banks and financial institutions to make informed lending decisions. Creditworthiness and financial stability are key factors that influence loan approvals, and accurate predictions in these areas can reduce default rates, streamline lending processes, and enhance financial inclusion. 

This project aims to explore several machine learning models that can predict the binary outcome of loan approval based on a range of demographic, financial, and historical data. If time permits, we will also work on predicting the risk score using regression.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is a synthetic dataset designed for risk assessment and loan approval modeling, sourced from Kaggle:  
[Financial Risk for Loan Approval Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lorenzozoppelletto/financial-risk-for-loan-approval/data)  

It contains 20,000 records with 36 attributes related to demographic information, credit history, income levels, existing debt, and financial stability. Key features include:
- Age
- Credit score
- Employment status
- Loan amount
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Previous loan defaults, and more.

This dataset provides a comprehensive foundation for building models that predict:
1. **Risk Score** (a regression problem)
2. **Loan Approval Status** (a binary classification problem)
